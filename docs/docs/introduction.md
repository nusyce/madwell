# Welcome to eDemand

Welcome to eDemand – your all-in-one solution for managing and operating a powerful service-based application platform.

This documentation will help you set up, customize, and launch your eDemand platform, whether you are working with the mobile app, the web admin panel, or both.

## About This Documentation

This guide covers both the ***eDemand Mobile App, web*** and the Admin Panel. While they are distinct products, they are designed to work seamlessly together.

## Version Compatibility

To ensure everything runs smoothly, it's important to use matching versions:

- Your Admin Panel version must match your App/Web version
- For example, if you're using App/Web version 1.0.0, your Admin Panel must also be version 1.0.0

## Getting Started

To set up your eDemand platform, follow these steps in order:

1. **Admin Panel Setup** - Configure your backend management system
2. **Firebase Configuration** - Set up the required Firebase services
3. **App/Web Setup** - Deploy your frontend application
4. **Rebranding** - Customize the platform to match your brand
5. **Deployment** - Launch your service platform to production
