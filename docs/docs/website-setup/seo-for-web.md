# SEO for Web

Enabling SEO (Search Engine Optimization) for your eDemand web application requires a VPS server and additional configuration. This guide explains how to set it up.

:::warning
This section is for advanced users who have a VPS server and are familiar with Node.js, npm, and pm2. If you don't need SEO functionality, you can use the [Deployment Without SEO](./deployment-without-seo.md) approach instead.

## Enabling SEO Mode

To enable SEO for your web application:

1. Open the `.env` file in your project's root directory
2. Find the `NEXT_PUBLIC_SEO` variable
3. Set its value to `"true"`

- A VPS (Virtual Private Server) with at least 3-4GB of free RAM

- Node.js (version 18 or later) installed
- A Linux-based operating system (preferably Debian-based)

## SEO Benefits

Enabling SEO mode provides several advantages:

- Server-side rendering of pages for better search engine indexing
- Improved page load times for users
- Better handling of meta tags and structured data
- Support for social media preview cards
- Improved accessibility for users with slower connections
